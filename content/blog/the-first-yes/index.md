description: "How Imposter Syndrome hit after my first informal job acceptance"
---

I was recently extended an informal offer as a TA for a tech pipeline program. I will share more information once things become more official. When I read the email I cried. I got this email yesterday and I haven't stopped smiling. I wanted this opportunity so badly and I am feeling to begin working with such a supportive group of people. 

But then it hit me, I am still asking MY TA's questions. I still get confused about coding problems, I still mix my syntax up and I still need to Google information. I have been spending a lot of time thinking about these things and have also considered withdrawing my application. Just think about that for a second. I have spent 20-30 hours a week outside of class building projects, learning skills and expanding my skill set and thought it was a mistake that someone wants to hire me.

That, my friends, is imposter syndrome. I spoke to a couple of people who reminded me that ALL engineers still look up information on the internet, all engineers run into bugs and need help from their peers, all engineers forget the sytax of things when they are developing code- AND EACH ONE IS A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPER. I would never argue that with anyone, except when it comes to myself.

I am going to keep blogging during my path of looking for full time work and my experiences as a TA as things develop, but in the meantime, I am going to be working on not selling myself short. I have a new skill set that I have worked very hard to learn and develop. I have worked on developing beginner cirriculm because I love education and want to share these skills with as many people as possible. I am a woman and I transitioned into this field from a different field. I have over 300 commits on my github from this year and many different projects that I have built that show the progression of my skill. I am a great candidiate for this role and I am going to do everything in my power to be an amazing TA for the people that I will be supporting.

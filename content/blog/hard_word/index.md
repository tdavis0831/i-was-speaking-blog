I don't even have time for my love life, to see my family, I don't even have time for nothin! I'm workin every single day - I'm depressed. -Cardi B

Full disclaimer: I am still in a boot camp currently and have not completely finished, but I finally see alight at the end of the tunnel. My final project is complete outside of styling and my presentations surrounding it and I am feeling like a developer (which is exactly how I should feel, but ya know, imposter syndrome).

First off, I attend a boot camp that is in California and I live in in NYC. I attend a part time cohort that started in July 2021 and goes until January 2022. My classes are Tuesday and Thursday 9 PM-12AM and Saturday 1 PM-9 PM and occur over zoom. The reason that I chose this boot camp is that I needed a part time program with later hours due to work and this was the most convenient. I also loved (and still do) the idea of attending a boot camp with only women and so I made the leap.

The boot camp told me before I started that they don’t encourage people to do too much work outside of the boot camp to prevent burn out from a 6-month program. I feel like that is unrealistic and out of the people that I know in my class, everyone puts in time outside of class, but I will only speak on my behalf.

The first thing that I did was get a planner dedicated to just class. Once the class materials were given out, I put all homework, deadlines, assessments, and all other important dates into the planner to start the skeleton of my timeline.

Repetition is very important for me, so I always tried to review the lecture that we did at least one time on my own outside of class and make note of things that I didn’t understand to return to it. When I returned to things, it really depended on the concept or problems. Sometimes I needed to watch a few YouTube videos, sometimes I need to do practice problems, sometimes I needed assistance from a teaching assistant at my school, but I always made sure I understand what I didn’t grasp in class.

I also worked on projects outside of class. This was not recommended by the school but was something that I felt was necessary for my learning and portfolio. So, I began working on small websites to practice flask routing and styling and created small python projects to practice back-end coding. I also made sure that I was pushing code as often as possible to GitHub to have a history of the work that I was putting in.

I hired an outside mentor to work with me specifically on React, job searching, and other areas where I felt like I would need support. With my mentor John, who is wonderful, we created 2 projects in React and are always working on more. 

I started working on my resume about 2 months before my boot camp suggested we started doing so. This is something that John and I did independently and is something that I am very happy I did. It has been a long process re-working a resume and I also created a CV site to go along with it that I host on GitHub pages. I learned along the way there are a lot of little things that you can do to stand out from the crowd, and so I try to go the extra mile. If you have the time to build a CV site and a few projects to show off your skills, do it!!!!

I also spent time networking. This was really fun for me and something that I recommend. The first convention that I attended was PyCon and I couldn’t afford to go, so I emailed the event coordinator and asked if I could volunteer in exchange for a registration. I was able to assist with the fitness portion of their convention, had a really awesome time, met cool people and got to attend the convention. I was able to network with a company and was invited to their discord and am still in touch with them to this day. I also got some awesome swag and of course, got to add PyCon volunteer to my resume. From there I have reached out to many conventions that have either offered the same volunteer opportunity or provided me a registration for free. I highly recommend doing this!!!!!!!! 

I of course used every color flash card, white board, notebook, highlighter study trick there was. I printed out notes and went over them, taking notes, looking up clarifying information and trying to learn as much as possible as quickly as possible. I mentioned YouTube, but I can’t stress how helpful some tutorials are and really helped me understand some core concepts.

Once the job hunting started coming closer (the past few weeks), I also started dedicated 2-5 hours a week to solving algorithms. Sometimes I do not hit this goal for myself, but I can start to see the beginning of this paying off recently. I feel like I am starting to understand concepts easier and when I see a problem, my brain starts to break it down in an efficient engineering type way. Keep practicing, keep sticking with it and I think it really does pay off (so far so good!) 

I know we, as developers, are always going to be learning and there is always time to learn, but I also came into this boot camp knowing that I was going to give it my all and make the most that I could of this program. I did fail to mention that I have also been working as a social worker during this entire educational experience and finding time for this wasn't incredibly hard- but I had to rearrange ALL OF MY PRIORITIES for 6 months (The joke is that it was really hard). I had to get used to staying up until midnight using my brain twice a week, I had to get used to skipping concerts and activities on Saturdays. 

I missed camping trips, parties, BBQ’s, and more but I also knew that was going to happen going into the boot camp. What I did get from this was an investment to myself, I showed myself that I can do anything that I put my mind to. I took charge of my life and took the steps needed for the eventual shift out of a career that I do not find fulfilling. There is nothing that I missed, from the parties to the sleep, that will ever replace the pride that completing this program has given me. 

And that is why we work, bitch.

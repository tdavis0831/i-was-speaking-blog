Hello, Friend.

I have a confession. I have not coded since completing my final project. My current job (that I LOVE) is not a programming job- I use logic and needed my bootcamp regardless, but am not actively using my Python skills. I have been thinking about getting back into teaching as it is something that I have begun to miss now that I am not experiencing burn out. I think I underestimated how much going to a bootcamp part time, working in social work full time while still navigating personal problems and the state of the world would take a toll on me.

I took a step back because I needed it, and then I thought to myself 2 days ago- I want to get back into coding. Then the next day I got an email about a teaching position at my previous school. I am not sure if I will get the job, but that's not really what matters. What matters is that it drove me to open my VS code and github for the first time since January.

I caught up recently with some old classmates that are now friends who ensured me returning to coding would be like riding a bike- they didn't tell me that I would need all forms of protective gear. I had to look up git commands, terminal commands, forgot the "%" was the modulo sign and struggled pushing all of my changes to github.

		But I did it.

After 4 months, I was able to complete a very simple python problem and push it to github. That is all I can ask for a random night of picking back up.

I am planning on going back through my bootcamp problems. I am not looking to change positions, but I do want to keep the skills that I worked really hard to obtain.

Oh, one cool thing I did was code this:

I created a version of wordle for one of my favorite comic books! 

I am so thankful for the changes that have been made in my life so far, and I plan on writing about them more, but for now a brief check-in. Maybe this encourages you to spend 30 minutes coding like I did today, or revisit something you have been wanting to do for a while not coding related. 

As always, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, or just to connect via LinkedIn or GitHub! Both linked below!

I am a perfectionist. Perhaps it stems from childhood trauma (most of us have it, you don't have to be ashamed) or because I am
a Virgo, but it’s there. Most times it is really easy for me to get caught up pushing myself to do more or be better; my expectations of myself are limitless and undefined. I was working with a mentor (John) today working on a project that I felt should have been easier for me to understand. We were able to finish the problem, but I had to ask a lot of questions, had to have the same concepts explained to me multiple times, and had to break down problems many different times. And at the end, like I said, we were able to finish. I could feel myself wanting to cry from embarrassment for having to look up answers to questions I should know the answer to, I was frustrated and disappointed in that moment.

Once we finished, I asked John for advice on how to get better at the concepts we were working on and he said, “First, you should stop being so hard on yourself because you are doing really good”, the rest of the conversation was helpful and we ended the call and I came here to write this. What a profound thought- a good way to get better at coding is to stop being so hard on yourself. 
I can’t stop thinking about this and processing this. I can’t stop thinking that the only expectations that I have on my skills at this time are the ones that I have placed on myself. The only person is ever disappointed by my work is me. The only person to feel negatively about the code I write is me. I have, not once, encountered another human (to my face) tell me that my work was bad, inadequate, below expectation or anything of the sort. 

Wow. 

>Your value doesn't decrease based on

>even if that someone is you.

In the past 12 months, I have gone from someone that didn’t even know what a programming language was and now I am able to code in multiple languages, use many libraries and frameworks, I have created more than one website, am weeks from completing a full stack coding boot camp and continually give back the knowledge that was given to me. How could I possibly be disappointed in all that I have accomplished this year?

It is very easy to get swept away by the expectations that I have of myself, while I struggle to acknowledge my accomplishments and this isn’t fair to myself, so I need to start working on a change. First off, I am going to try to write down a skill daily that I have learned in the past year to reflect on the volume of information that I have learned. I am also going to start practicing some self-compassion. It is very easy for me to be understanding, proud, and encouraging of others and I need to start practicing these kind values with myself.  I would never talk to friend the way that I talk to myself and I don’t deserve that.

I think I needed to say out loud that I acknowledge that I am really hard on myself and I am going to start to take steps to reduce this. I think that there will always be self-criticism inside of me, but I believe, there can exist a part that is also kind, compassionate, proud, and loving to myself for all of the amazing things I have accomplished so far!

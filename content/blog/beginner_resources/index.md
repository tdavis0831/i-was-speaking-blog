A few people have asked me what resources I used before attending my bootcamp- so here a list of some websites that were incredibly helpful!  


Before I decided to go into coding I tried IT and took a free google IT course https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support. I had to apply for financial aid, but after I completed the course I was able to add a badge to my LinkedIn showing that I had done the course! It was helpful to learn more about computers before a bootcamp and I recommend this or something like it if you are unfamiliar with computers like I was! 


The first coding resource is https://adadevelopersacademy.org/prepare/ada-build-live/
Ada’s mission per their website is “Ada’s mission is to prepare women and gender expansive adults to be software developers while advocating for inclusive and equitable work environments. We prioritize serving Black, Latine, Indigenous Americans, Native Hawaiian & Pacific Islander, LGBTQIA+, and low-income people.” I was able to attend an Ada build session which included live help through their prep course that many people took to get ready for the application process. I was able to connect with a lot of women and start networking because of this program. I also learned so much from the instructors and was able to sign up for one on one sessions for help. I am not sure if this is how this program still runs but that it how it was when I attended. Ada developers offers a no cost bootcamp and guaranteed internship placement, so even though I didn’t get in, if you meet the criteria, I encourage you to connect and apply! 


Another course that was awesome was Standford’s Code in Place https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/. This program was not as individualized or personal, but included cool projects and good fundamental skills. There is a community that they encourage people to be active in, but I did not do that unfortunately. If you have the time I encourage you to apply to this program! 


Freecodecamp.org is one of my favorite websites for free information. You can complete their courses and get free certificates of completion that you can add to your resume or just take whichever classes you want to learn more about. They also have a great community which I did use for questions occasionally. The instructors are great, there are so many good things that I could say about this website. 
I used https://www.udemy.com/ just a couple of times. I signed up and completed about half of the complete 2021 webdevelopent class, but they have a 2022, which I am sure is good quality. I took with Dr. Angela Yu- I am a big fan of hers. I didn’t finish the course but the front end skills I learned from her stuck with me to my bootcamp! 


I also went to the following conventions:
PyCon https://us.pycon.org/2022/
A WITS Summit  https://womenintechsummit.net/
GopherCon  https://www.gophercon.com/home


I was unable to afford to attend these conventions because of the pandemic and I reached out to reach of these conventions and offered to volunteer in exchange for admission. GopherCon was actually a free one! I used these conventions to learn, but to also connect with different companies. I always reached out to everyone with a booth and connected with them on LinkedIn. I was able to make a really cool connection with an API company and they even had a couple of their engineers walk through some of their code with me a few weeks later. Plus, I have enough convention swag shirts I will never have to shop again!

There are so many resources out there, but these are the main ones that I found helpful. Feel free to reach out if you have other sites out there that deserve to be talked about! And as always, click any of the buttons below to connect with me!
